          <p>Anthill is the place students go to find work and businesses go to workers for short term jobs.  Help us take Anthill to the next level.  We're raising $25,000 for <a href="#">these reasons</a>.  Take a look at who we are or head right to our <a href="#">donation page</a>.</p>
          <p>Anthill is first and foremost community minded.  We're made by students for students, but we don't discriminate against age.  Everyone needs experience and everyone needs to work.  We are dedicated to helping the past, present, and future generations learn skills, work hard and get a taste of what it's like to be in the tech field. That's why we're opening our doors, giving back to the community in a creative way, and documenting the whole summer.</p>

          <p>Even as a recent graduate, Marcella has done everything from lobbying for a universal health care firm, to software engineering, to interning at a hedge fund. Nothing has added fuel to her fire like incubating Anthill and creating a solution to an issue that negatievly affects every human: unemployment.  Anthill has brought her through a two business plan competitions, to Las Vegas as Thiel Foundation Summiteer, and onto a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NzNs8FAudQ">TEDx</a> stage where she discussed her philosophy behind entrepreneurship in a talk titled "Passion, Programming, and Pragmatism." </p>

          <h3 class="primary-text"><b>Head of Product at Anthill</b></h3>
          <p>Hailing from the deep woods of New Hamspire, Matt's taken quite a liking to hacking away on Anthill.  Matt Barth spends most of his awake hours prowling google and stack overflow looking for ways to make Anthill's tech stack bigger and better.  He also crunches data in his spare time just like he crunches on the omnipresent toothpick in his mouth.  On the side, Matt dreams about making it big one day with his ska band, Fun Lovin' Dudes (but he's afraid of big cities, so that dream will probably stay close to the pillows). If you donate $5000 or more, Matt with send you a bottle of his family's famous maple syrup from New Hampshire.  Isn't he great?</p>

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The philosophy behind the movement: Hard working ants in a concentrated area build magnificent, strong, and intricate little cities. Ants have a division of labor, communication between individuals, an ability to solve complex problems.</p>
        <p><span class="primary-text">Most importantly, they live and work together.</span></p>
        <p>Their ecosystems are emblematic of cities.  Anthills represent a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Ants are sharers, creators, builders, communicators, and laborers. So are we, and we are ready to work.</p>
