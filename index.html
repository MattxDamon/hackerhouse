Marcella is working on Anthill.  “Anthill?”, you say. “That sounds mighty similar to the name of this here institution you’re asking me to donate money too.” Well yes, it is. The Anthill was her idea, and that’s why we named the house after her dog, Anthill. She’s chock full of great ideas. Her grandfather invented the abacus.</p>

          <h3 class="primary-text"><b>Head of Product at Anthill</b></h3>
          <p>Hailing from the deep woods of New Hamspire, Matt's taken quite a liking to hacking away on Anthill.  Matt Barth spends most of his awake hours prowling google and stack overflow looking for ways to make Anthill's tech stack bigger and better.  He also crunches data in his spare time just like he crunches on the omnipresent toothpick in his mouth.  On the side, Matt dreams about making it big one day with his ska band, Fun Lovin' Dudes (but he's afraid of big cities, so that dream will probably stay close to the pillows). If you donate $5000 or more, Matt with send you a bottle of his family's famous maple syrup from New Hampshire.  Isn't he great?</p>

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The philosophy behind the movement: Hard working ants in a concentrated area build magnificent, strong, and intricate little cities. Ants have a division of labor, communication between individuals, an ability to solve complex problems.</p>
        <p><span class="primary-text">Most importantly, they live and work together.</span></p>
        <p>Their ecosystems are emblematic of cities.  Anthills represent a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Ants are sharers, creators, builders, communicators, and laborers. So are we, and we are ready to work.</p>
