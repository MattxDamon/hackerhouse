        <h3>Hunter Fortuin</h3>
        <p>Hunter grew up in the middle of the country with no Internet connection, no computer, no water, no food, and no dog. But somehow, he fought his way up from the depths of manual labor and learned to program. He started his first startup in his sophomore year of high-school with Shane Boland. They went on to lose so many business plan competitions. So many.</p>

        <p>Shane Boland is good at one thing, and one thing only. Being tall, and being really terrible at foosball. Honestly, it’s just painful to observe. Absolute trash.</p>
